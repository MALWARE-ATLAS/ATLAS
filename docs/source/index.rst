Welcome to ATLAS's documentation!
===================================

**ATLAS** is an analysis description of malware or kill-chain. Malware is a combination of techniques crafted for a purpose. With an ATLAS rule, these techniques and capabilities are put into different buckets. In this way, it tries to help malware researchers to focus single bucket at a time and nothing more. They don't need to think about the connection of the buckets. ATLAS interpretation of the rule does the job. It also removes the language boundaries. Different buckets can be written in other script languages.

If these techniques are transformed into buckets properly, it eventually creates a memory. Then, the total time to write an ATLAS rule will decrease after some period.
